- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dale McBride!
- I am a student at Brigham Young University Idaho at the moment and am studying Computer Science and Data Science!
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things. Computers definitely have always been super interesting to me, but I also really like to be outdoors and hike backpack as well as hunt and fish. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and using Python for data analysis as well as web development. I have found that I like both of these.
